Responsible for starting, mantaining and ending the communication session between two devices. Manages the turns of sending and recieving data for both devices and handles session recovery if the connection dies.

It's like the **moderator** in the conversation.

The [[Session Layer]] ensures that communication stays **organized**, **synchronized**, and can **recover from disruptions**.

The [[Session Layer]] decides how communication happens:
1. **Full-Duplex**: Both sides can talk at the same time (e.g. Zoom).
2. **Half-Duplex**: One side can talk at a time (e.g. Walkie Talkie).

It's also responsible for **Authentication** and **Authorization**.

The [[Session Layer]] passes **organized, session-aware data** to the [[Transport Layer]] for reliable or best-effort delivery. `Hereâ€™s a stream of data for this session between two applications, please deliver it`
